## Basic React Carousel

After looking up react image carousel component libraries, I felt like I was putting the cart before the horse and wanted to try to just a simple one for my own use and here is the result.

Using:

- tailwindcss
- fontawesome icons

Depending on the use case, in the future I would add:

- mobile controls
- increased accessibility
- props for width/height

run locally:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
